# Autoencoder with PyTorch

Here lies a simple autoencoder implementation using PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning and its utilities, done in order to learn about PyTorch.  

The implementation in `ae` was a first look into PyTorch's environment and therefore has a lot of tests. In `solid-ae`, my attempt was to make a more object-oriented approach to the NN.  

There's nothing special here, wayfarer.
